The following project is related to the Cricket Analysis which shows how Jasprit Bumrah have bowled aganist all other batsman. With the help of the code written and the scattered plots obtained through it, we can figure out that batsman like AB de Villers have played aganist him exceptionally well with a strike rate of about 145, while MS Dhoni has struggled aganist Bumrah with a strike rate of 96.
This could be helpful for the teams about how they should tackle Bumrah and what kind of runs could be scored aganist him for the maximum number of times.
